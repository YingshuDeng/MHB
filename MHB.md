Question 1: Why do we make the assumption of no exogenous labor supply?

Question 2: if households wants to borrow $A_1 < A$ min in $t = 1$, then $c_2 < 0$, which can never be optimal.

Constant Relative Risk Aversion and euler equation:

  $\frac{c_2}{c_1}=[\frac{1+r}{1+\rho}]^{\frac{1}{\theta}}$ in which $[\frac{1+r}{1+\rho}]^{\frac{1}{\theta}}$ is [1+ comsumption growth rate].
  
  --> back to the budget constant and derive $c_1$ and $c_2$.
